    LibRecipes organizes trade skill recipes, spells and items into sets. LibRecipes is a 
    <a href="https://www.wowace.com/projects/libstub">LibStub</a> library for querying these sets. 
    Its focus is efficiency and speed.
</p>
<p>
    You can retrieve the spell taught by a recipe and the item it creates. Or you can find the recipe that teaches 
    a spell. In WoW there is a big difference between each of them. For example:
</p>
<p>
    <i>Item 37337  (Formula: Enchant Bracer - Greater Stats)</i>
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;teaches
    <br/>
    <i>spell 44616 (Greater Stats)</i>
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;which creates
    <br/>
    <i>item 38987  (Enchant Bracer - Greater Stats)</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Recipes, spells and items are all represented by numeric IDs. 
    You can use WoW API methods <a href="http://wowprogramming.com/docs/api/GetSpellInfo">GetSpellInfo(id)</a> and 
    <a href="http://wowprogramming.com/docs/api/GetItemInfo">GetItemInfo(id)</a> to retrieve the details respectively 
    of spell and recipe/item IDs.
</p>

    You can read about how to use LibRecipes in your mod on the 
    <a href="https://www.wowace.com/projects/librecipes-2-0/pages/api">API</a> page.
